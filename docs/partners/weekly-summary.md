## Top Frictions

1. Generated command descriptions are intentionally generic and require domain edits.
2. Install ergonomics can improve further (brew tap pending).
3. Need more diverse real-world onboarding samples.

## Decisions This Week

1. Keep strict contract-first onboarding flow as default.
2. Invest in runnable domain examples to reduce conceptual gap.

## Next Week Plan

1. Onboard 4 more design partners and record metrics.
2. Add Homebrew installation path.
3. Publish onboarding benchmark snapshot in docs.
